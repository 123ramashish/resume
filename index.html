        <p>Hello, I am Ram Ashish Kumar from Bihar. I have completed my high school degree in Bihar. Subsequently, I moved to another district in Bihar to pursue my Intermediate degree. During the Intermediate, I opted for the Science stream with Mathematics and focused on both Board and JEE levels. In my first attempt, I scored an 85th percentile in the JEE and also excelled in the Board exams.

My aspiration was to join IIT, so I went to Kota, Rajasthan, for IIT preparation. However, while studying in Kota, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, leading to a lockdown. Consequently, I decided to return home, and in that situation, I couldn't crack the IIT exam. I then secured admission to Sharda University for my undergraduate degree.

In my undergraduate studies, I chose B.Tech in Computer Science to pursue a better lifestyle and explore opportunities in the high-paying job market. I am focusing on development skills beyond the regular college syllabus.I have completed numerous projects in MERN stack development and continue to work on additional ones. </p>

          <div> <span>Coding</span> Since 2021, I've been busy with coding, solving lots of problems. I've used Java to solve challenges on websites like <span>GeeksForGeeks</span>, <span>CodingNinja</span>, <span>LeetCode</span>, and <span>CodeTantra</span>. It's been a journey where I've learned a lot about coding, especially about Data Structures and Algorithms. These websites have helped me practice and improve my skills in writing better code. I enjoy exploring new problems and finding solutions. It's like solving puzzles, but with computers. This journey has made me more passionate about coding, and I'm always excited to learn more and improve my skills further.  </div>
          <div> <span>Software</span>In software development, I've worked on many different projects using <span>HTML</span> & <span>CSS</span>, like making resume websites, music players, and more. I've also used <span>JavaScript</span> to create things like movie ticket booking systems, social media sites, and games. With <span>React</span>, I've built music players, social media platforms, and e-commerce sites. For the behind-the-scenes stuff, I've used <span>Node.js</span>, <span>Express.js</span>, <span>Mongoose</span>, and <span>MongoDB</span>. These projects helped me learn a lot about building websites and apps. I got to work on both the parts you see (frontend) and the parts that run behind the scenes (backend), which was pretty cool!</div>
          <div>Since 2021, I've been using <span>Microsoft tools</span> like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. In Word, I've made over 1000 pages for research work. With PowerPoint, I've created over 1000 slides for research presentations. These tools help me write and organize my research findings neatly, and I can also make slides to show my work to others. Using these tools has made it easier for me to share information and present my research in a clear and professional way. It's been really helpful for getting my work done and sharing it with others.</div>
          <div><span>IOT</span>I have built several projects in the field of Internet of Things (IoT), such as the <span>Smart Cane</span> and <span>Smart Shoes</span> for visually impaired individuals, and Women's Safety devices. Additionally, I developed <span>Sentical</span> devices aimed at protecting homes and cars from theft. These devices alert owners via messages and alarms when a thief attempts to steal objects from their house or car. This innovative technology enhances safety and security by leveraging IoT capabilities to provide real-time notifications and deterrents against theft, thereby offering peace of mind to homeowners and car owners alike.</div>

  <h3>Smart Cane for Blind People <span id="project-span">IOT</span></h3>
  <img id="project-image" src="iot-1.png" alt="">
  <p>The visually-impaired people tend to have a problem where they cannot navigate freely in an
environment either known or unknown to them. The existing of Smart Cane should aim to help
each visually-impaired people to navigate through their daily motion. The use of Smart Cane
should be optimized for usable and affordable enough that can be easily use by all the visually-
impaired. However, the current problem that we face today is that the visually-impaired people
tend to have a problem where they cannot navigate freely in an environment either known or
unknown to them. Hence, the visually-impaired people will not have confidence and also lost
their physical integrity in themselves. We also can see that because the visually-impaired people
cannot navigate properly, they need to adapt to the walking cane that they are using instead of
the walking cane itself needs to adapt with them. Thus, using the Smart Cane which will navigate
the users more accurately with the use of ultrasonic sensor and vibration motor attached to the
model can eliminate the problem faced.

  <h3>[Sentical]Smart Security Device <span id="project-span">IOT</span>
  </h3>
  <img id="project-image" src="iot-3.png" alt="">
  <p>This project is all about keeping homes and vehicles safe, like cars, motorcycles, and bicycles. Vehicle theft is a big problem worldwide, and it's still happening a lot. Thieves are getting smarter and finding new ways to steal vehicles, despite efforts from police and car makers. I'm trying to help with this issue using what I know. Thieves are always finding ways to beat security systems, like stealing keys or breaking into cars. My aim is to make it harder for them to steal vehicles, making life safer for vehicle owners and manufacturers.</p>

  <h3>Dynamically Resume Builder <span id="project-span">websites</span></h3>
    <img id="project-image" src="resumebuilder.png" alt="">
  <p>In the very competitive job market of today, it is crucial for job seekers to have a CV that stands out from the
competition. But many people find it difficult to write a polished résumé that effectively communicates their
abilities and expertise. This issue can be resolved by giving people a user-friendly platform to swiftly and easily
construct and customize their resumes on a resume-building website. The website can include a variety of
samples, instructions, and advice to assist users in creating their resumes, making it simpler for them to
highlight their individual skills and abilities. This website also makes a job recommendation to candidates based

          <div>I finished my 10th grade in Bihar with a score of 76%. That means I did pretty well on my exams. It shows that I understood the subjects I studied and put effort into learning them. This achievement tells others that I take my education seriously and I'm good at studying. </div>
          <div>I finished my 12th grade in Bihar, studying science with a focus on math. I did really well, scoring 85%. After that, I took the JEE exam and got an 85th percentile result. This shows that I'm good at math and science and that I worked hard in school. It also means that I did better than 85% of the people who took the JEE exam, which is pretty cool!</div>
          <div>After I finished high school, I decided to study Computer Science at Sharda University. I'm currently in my third year, and I'm doing well with a CGPA of 8.6. I chose Computer Science because I love technology and computers. Sharda University has been great, giving me a lot of opportunities to learn about programming, software development, and more. The teachers and resources here are really helpful. I'm excited to keep learning and exploring the world of computer science. Hopefully, when I finish, I'll be ready for a job in technology that lets me keep growing and learning.</div>
